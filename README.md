Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) is a signal processing technique that uses spatial filtering, and is commonly used in EEG. The goal of CSP is to find a set of spatial filters that can effectively differentiate between two classes of signals based on their covariance matrices.


For this experiment, we differentiate between right and left activities. The subject has a 16-electrodes cap placed on their hand, and is placed in front of a computer. For 8 trials separated in 2 different sessions, the subject is asked to imaginate squeezing an object (such as a tennis ball) into their right or left hand, in various orders. The EEG data is then recorded, filtered, and analyzed as to separate the trials between left and right.
The key objective of this experiment is to differentiate the distinct spatial patterns. We are more specifically analyzing the Mu waves, which are between 7.5 and 12.5Hz, and reflect the synchronous firing of motor neurons in rest state. When performing or imagining a movement, they become desynchronized. The differentiation is based on the topographical organization of the brain, where specific locations are associated with corresponding body parts.
